# Bubble Sort Algorithm
 This program applies the bubble sort algorithm to an array list in java


### How it works
The algorithm is applied to a string array list.
Bubble sort is used to compare an item in the list with the item next to it and if the first item is
bigger than the second item, they swap places. In this case, the algorithm focuses on the first letter of each string
to sort them alphabetically. This process iterates until all the items in the list
have been compared, then the process starts again until every word is in order.

e.g
**marc**, daya, chris, tony

daya, **marc**, chris, tony 

daya, chris, **marc** tony 

**daya**, chris, marc, tony 

chris, daya, marc, tony
